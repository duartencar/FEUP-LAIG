# Project 3

On this first project we were suposed to:

1.Create more than one game scene, so we created two diferent scenes with the same board, as you can see in the pictures below:
![gameScene1]
![gameScene2]

2. Make the necessary pieces so the game could be played. So we did:
  * Player 1 piece
  
    ![player1PieceImage]
  
  * Player 2 piece
  
    ![player2PieceImage]
  
  * Dice
  
    ![DiceImage]

3. Parse nodes with 'selectable' attribute :white_check_mark:

4. Apply a shader to the selectable node:
    - [x] Change object size according to time
    - [x] Change object color

5. Create a interface that:
    - [x] Selects one of the selectable nodes
    - [x] Applies one of the implemented nodes
