# Project 2

On this first project we were suposed to:

1.Parse an animation node with the animations data to apply to objects :white_check_mark:

2. Apply animations to objects.
    - Linear Animation:
        - [x] Movement
        - [ ] Rotation
    - Circular Animation:
        - [x] Movement
        - [ ] Rotation
    - Bezier Animation:
        - [x] Movement
        - [ ] Rotation
    - Bezier Animation:
        - [x] Movement

3. Parse nodes with 'selectable' attribute :white_check_mark:

4. Apply a shader to the selectable node:
    - [x] Change object size according to time
    - [x] Change object color

5. Create a interface that:
    - [x] Selects one of the selectable nodes
    - [x] Applies one of the implemented nodes
